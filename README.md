# Event Manager Project

This is a project that was done via [The Odin Project Ruby Track](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/event-manager-ruby-programming)

This was an interesting project, which showed that you can use ERB templating outside of rails or Sinatra.
